# [Your title]

> **TL;DR:** [One sentence describing what the reader will learn or accomplish.]

## The problem

[Describe the pain point, user need, incident, or question that prompted this post.]

## Why this approach

[Explain the important design choices and trade-offs in plain language.]

## Prerequisites

- [ ] [Required account, permission, tool, or service]
- [ ] [Required version or configuration]
- [ ] [Required input or repository state]

Verify important prerequisites:

    # Replace with a safe verification command.
    tool --version

## The solution

[Give a short overview before the detailed steps.]

### Step 1: [Action]

[Explain what the reader is doing, why it matters, and any assumptions.]

    # Use placeholders such as YOUR_PROJECT or EXAMPLE_VALUE.
    command --option EXAMPLE_VALUE

Expected result:

    [Representative output with secrets and personal data removed]

### Step 2: [Action]

[Continue with the next meaningful step and include a verification point when useful.]

    command --option EXAMPLE_VALUE

### Step 3: [Action]

[Include gotchas, decision points, or a practical lesson.]

> **Pro tip:** [Practical lesson learned from experience.]

## Complete example

    # Filename: example-script.sh
    # Replace placeholders before running. Do not include real secrets.

    command_one
    command_two
    command_three

## How it works

[Summarize the end-to-end flow. Add a diagram only when it clarifies a non-obvious relationship.]

        A[Input] --> B[Process]
        B --> C[Output]

| Component | Role |
| --- | --- |
| Input | [What enters the flow] |
| Process | [What transforms or evaluates it] |
| Output | [What is produced or changed] |

## Security considerations

Never publish real credentials, tokens, private data, customer data, or sensitive infrastructure details.

| Principle | Application |
| --- | --- |
| Least privilege | [Permissions are limited to what the example needs] |
| Defense in depth | [Independent control or validation] |
| Auditability | [Safe logs, evidence, or review trail] |

## Troubleshooting

### [Common error message]

**Cause:** [Why the error occurs.]
**Solution:** [How to resolve it safely.]

    # Sanitized remediation command, if applicable.
    fix-command --option EXAMPLE_VALUE

## Verification and cleanup

- [ ] [Functional result verified]
- [ ] [Expected failure or boundary case checked]
- [ ] [Temporary resources, files, permissions, or subscriptions removed]
- [ ] [No secret or personal data remains in commands, output, or screenshots]
