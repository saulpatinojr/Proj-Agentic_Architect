## Change and desired end state

<!-- What resource, configuration, or platform behavior changes? What should the final state be? -->

## Why

<!-- Business, reliability, security, cost, compliance, or engineering driver. If this alters an accepted ADR, identify it and create a new ADR before implementation. Use the [ADR template](adr.yml) and link the decision record when one exists. -->

## Scope and blast radius

- Environments affected:
- Stateful data or persistent resources affected (stateful resources carry `prevent_destroy`):

- Dependencies and consumers:
- Authorization or trust-boundary impact:

## Cost and operational impact

- Estimated recurring and one-time cost:
- Cost impact versus the USD 150/month ceiling:
- Performance, availability, backup, monitoring, or support impact:
- New required inputs, approvals, or secrets:
- New required inputs for Required-Inputs:
