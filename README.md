# Code Conductor

Code Conductor is a **VS Code-centered, multi-provider agent engineering system**. It coordinates subscription-backed AI clients, reusable APM agent packs, official MCP tools/references, safe context preparation, Git worktrees, GitHub pull requests, deterministic quality gates, and human approval without collapsing every provider into a generic chat interface.

## Status

**Target:** v0.1 workstation/VS Code release  
**Current checkpoint:** the approved v0.1 architecture/product delta is implemented on `main`: surface-aware harnesses and provider specialization/routing, a guarded Kiro ACP path, self-contained thin-client packaging/lazy startup, immutable Agent Catalog intake tooling, and the VSIX packaging foundation. The active critical path is now clean-machine/workstation validation plus real R1/R2 dogfood. The first-party context optimizer remains a conservative context-preparation capability; its MCP transport is experimental until official-SDK/current-protocol validation is complete.

See [`docs/STATUS.md`](docs/STATUS.md) for the maintained checkpoint and GitHub issue **#7** for the durable product roadmap/backlog.

## Product shape

Code Conductor v0.x is intentionally **not another standalone desktop app**.

- VS Code is the primary graphical cockpit.
- The Code Conductor extension stays thin and deep-links into native provider/editor/terminal/diff/SCM/PR surfaces.
- An optional thin `cc` CLI/TUI uses the same versioned core/runtime.
- The packaged extension now bundles the compiled Code Conductor runtime; clean-machine validation and Marketplace publication still must prove customers do not need this source tree or a local `npm run build` step.
- First run performs explicit local discovery/bootstrap; subsequent starts use cached non-secret state and lazy provider/MCP/APM activation.

## Architecture at a glance

| Layer | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| VS Code | Human cockpit and native editor/terminal/diff/SCM/provider surfaces |
| Code Conductor | Task DAG, routing, risk, authority, context policy, evidence, arbitration, readiness |
| Surface-aware harness adapters | Native extensions, CLI/headless, ACP, MCP, platform workflows/APIs, manual lanes, provider-native agents/subagents/skills/hooks/plugins |
| Context preparation | Provider-neutral, workspace-bounded context reduction; lossless by default, aggressive only by explicit opt-in |
| Microsoft APM | Agent-pack dependency, distribution, lock, projection, integrity, drift |
| MCP | Vendor-official and approved first-party tools/resources; not the runtime scheduler |
| Deterministic tools | Terraform, Ansible, PowerShell, cloud CLIs, Git, Kubernetes/Helm, linters/tests/build tools |
| Git worktrees | Isolated modifying-agent workspaces |
| GitHub | Repository, PR, Actions, review, and merge source of truth |
| Human owner | Final authority for consequential/destructive operations |

The repository constitution is [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md). Locked architectural decisions are in [`docs/DECISIONS.md`](docs/DECISIONS.md). The context-optimization boundary is recorded in ADR 0007, the thin-client/startup model in ADR 0008, and the surface-aware harness/provider-specialization model in ADR 0009.

## Team model

Code Conductor separates **provider, model, harness, surface, billing channel, role, stance, specialization, tools, authority, and risk clearance**. Primary specialization is a routing preference, not exclusivity.

| Provider / platform | Primary Code Conductor specialization |
|---|---|
| **Kiro** | specification/design/task planning, AWS specialist, Kiro-native workflows; preferred Code Conductor boundary is `kiro-cli acp` where policy/workstation validation permits it |
| **Claude Code** | large-codebase engineering, refactoring, deep codebase reasoning |
| **Codex** | implementation, debugging, testing, repository execution |
| **GitHub Copilot / GitHub** | GitHub-native Gatekeeper for PR review/re-review, Actions/PR state, repository/merge context |
| **Perplexity** | external research discovery/synthesis; Pro subscription mode remains human-in-the-loop unless separately billed official MCP/API automation is explicitly enabled |
| **Google Antigravity** | Google/GCP specialist and alternate independent worker/reviewer; unattended execution remains gated by validated authority/sandbox behavior |
| **Code Conductor** | orchestration, risk, routing, authority, evidence, gates, arbitration; it coordinates rather than competes with the specialists |

Provider-native subagents, skills, hooks, commands/plugins/Powers, sessions, permissions, and MCP capabilities should remain available where officially supported. Cross-provider AI invocation remains mediated by Code Conductor so worktree ownership, billing channel, authority, evidence, and readiness are not bypassed.

Important work can add independent constructive, critical/challenger, neutral validator, security, arbiter, and finalizer roles according to risk.

## Agent and skill platform

`.apm/` is the canonical source for reusable agent/skill content. Harness-specific Claude/Codex/Copilot/Kiro/Agent Skills projections are generated/materialized rather than manually maintained as divergent copies.

The user's larger legacy agent/skill library is tracked as a dedicated migration workstream in issue #13. The immutable inventory/lineage intake mechanism is implemented; the actual corpus review and migration are still pending. The migration rule is **100% source-lineage coverage**: every original file is preserved/inventoried and receives a canonical destination or explicit duplicate/superseded disposition before retirement. The goal is modular APM packages with lean personas, reusable deep skills/references, and provider overlays only for genuine harness differences.

## Quick start

Prerequisites for repository development are Git, Node.js 22+ (Node 24 recommended), GitHub CLI, and APM 0.30.0. Subscription-backed execution additionally requires the official vendor clients/surfaces described in [`docs/WORKSTATION-VALIDATION.md`](docs/WORKSTATION-VALIDATION.md).

```bash
npm ci --ignore-scripts
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run cc:validate
```

Validate APM state:

```bash
apm targets
apm audit --ci --policy ./apm-policy.yml --no-fail-fast
```

Run workstation diagnostics after building the development checkout:

```bash
npm run cc:doctor
```

Prepare a repository file as context after building. Reads are scoped to the supplied root and sensitive/state paths are blocked:

```bash
node packages/cli/dist/index.js compress README.md --root .
```

That command is lossless/conservative by default. `--aggressive` is an explicit opt-in for content where removing comments/extra whitespace is known to be acceptable. Token counts shown by this local optimizer are estimates, not provider billing or quota data.

Do not enable unattended paid-client execution until the appropriate **surface-specific** trust/smoke validation passes on that workstation. Kiro in particular must validate the approved ACP/native boundary rather than relying only on the older generic CLI smoke path.

## Repository truth model

- GitHub issue #7 / the linked GitHub Project is the durable product roadmap/backlog once the Project is created.
- `.apm/` is canonical source for reusable agent/skill pack content in this repository.
- `apm.yml` declares package targets/dependencies.
- `apm.lock.yaml` and harness-specific projections are generated/materialized state and are committed for reproducibility; do not hand-edit the lockfile.
- `config/mcp-catalog.yaml` is Code Conductor's policy-driven MCP catalog. `.github/mcp.json` is a minimal Copilot CLI repository configuration, not a second catalog.
- Git is code-state truth; GitHub is PR/CI/review/merge truth.
- Code Conductor run/evidence state is runtime truth, not a replacement for Git/GitHub.
- Chat is design collaboration, not durable product truth; approved substantive ideas are captured in GitHub issues/ADRs/config/tests before they are considered preserved.
