# Code Conductor status

**Checkpoint:** 2026-09-18  
**Target:** v0.1 workstation/VS Code release

## Current state

The approved architecture and implementation work from the roadmap/chat consolidation is now incorporated into `main`. ADR 0008/0009 and decisions D-048 through D-056 are canonical, and the corresponding runtime/product foundations have landed rather than remaining only in feature branches.

Merged implementation includes surface-aware provider/harness capabilities and specialization routing, a guarded Kiro ACP client path using the official ACP SDK boundary, a self-contained bundled VS Code runtime with lazy startup/fingerprinting, the immutable Agent Catalog intake/lineage mechanism, and the VSIX packaging foundation with a pinned official `@vscode/vsce` toolchain. The earlier context-optimizer retrofit remains part of the baseline under ADR 0007.

The repository is therefore past the architecture-delta stage. The active v0.1 critical path is now live workstation validation and dogfood under issue #4: official subscription authentication, surface-specific read/modify smoke, Kiro ACP policy/authority validation, representative MCP/tool profiles, then real R1/R2 execution with GitHub Gatekeeper evidence.

Parallel work continues under #13 for the actual legacy corpus migration and #14 for Marketplace publication/provenance/customer-trust automation. The intake and VSIX packaging foundations are implemented; full corpus migration and public release hardening are not yet complete.

## Verified in repository/CI

- TypeScript workspace builds successfully on Node 24.
- Current consolidated unit suite passes: **80 tests across 18 test files**.
- `cc validate` passes repository policy/configuration validation.
- `npm ci --ignore-scripts` and `npm audit --audit-level=high` report **0 vulnerabilities**.
- `package-lock.json` is committed and normal dependency CI remains read-only/reproducible.
- APM 0.30.0 remains pinned; `apm.lock.yaml` and generated harness projections are committed and APM audit passes.
- Canonical APM agent/skill sources project to Copilot, Claude, Codex, Kiro, and Agent Skills targets.
- Task planning, structured result contracts, risk/policy checks, deterministic gates, run persistence, bounded retries, and modifying worktree support remain implemented and covered by the existing regression suite.
- Planner assignments project configured authority labels, select explicit execution surfaces/specializations, and enforce the configured R2+ different-provider challenger requirement fail-closed when it cannot be satisfied.
- CLI commands cover repository validation, surface-aware doctor/planning/execution, harness smoke tests, MCP selection, APM audit, GitHub gate inspection, context statistics, and bounded file-based context preparation.
- The context optimizer preserves comments/instructions by default, permits aggressive removal only explicitly, compacts valid JSON semantically, and does not inject provider-specific cache-control markup into core output.
- Context file reads are restricted to approved workspace roots after canonical/symlink resolution and reject sensitive/state paths, non-regular files, and oversized inputs.
- Context telemetry is owner-private on POSIX systems and token counts are explicitly estimates rather than provider billing/quota data.
- The context optimizer is cataloged as a Code Conductor first-party **experimental** MCP adapter rather than a vendor-official/GA server, and catalog policy requires explicit first-party approval.
- The repository-specific GitHub Copilot review skill is retained and aligned with Code Conductor's context/MCP boundaries.
- Repository-scoped Copilot CLI MCP configuration is minimal under `.github/mcp.json`; the duplicate `.github/copilot-mcp.json`, transplanted Copilot setup workflow, and unused GitHub App token minter were removed because they duplicated platform-native paths and referenced infrastructure not owned by this repository.
- GitHub Actions used by maintained workflows remain pinned to reviewed immutable commit SHAs; executable Ansible/Azure MCP package references remain pinned rather than floating.
- Local run/evidence directories/files, workstation trust state, modifying-agent worktree directories, and context-optimizer telemetry use owner-only permissions on POSIX systems where applicable.
- Evidence run-directory traversal, Git rename/copy sensitive-path handling, ref sanitization, recursive gate matching, lazy profile scanning, advisory-gate semantics, non-git GitHub MCP selection, fail-closed workstation trust, and schema-validated `AgentResult` parsing remain covered by regression tests.
- CodeQL reports no new alerts in the retrofit after the Markdown comment-removal implementation was changed from a problematic regex to a bounded linear parser.
- Dependency review passes and GitGuardian reports no secrets in the current retrofit PR head.
- GitHub Copilot review findings on empty context payload handling, explicit first-party MCP approval, profile-name consistency, provider-surface configuration, Kiro ACP process/timeout behavior, startup fingerprinting, bundle verification, and immutable catalog intake were fixed with regression coverage.
- Surface-aware capability/routing behavior is implemented for Kiro/AWS/specification, Claude/refactor, Codex/debug/test, GitHub Gatekeeper, Perplexity research, and Antigravity/GCP lanes.
- The Kiro adapter uses an ACP client path with fail-closed permission handling, bounded cancellation/teardown, surface-specific workstation trust, and deterministic fake-ACP tests; live Kiro subscription/policy authority still requires workstation validation.
- The VS Code extension bundles its compiled Code Conductor runtime and uses workspace-scoped fingerprints/lazy discovery rather than requiring a repository-local runtime build for normal packaged use.
- The Agent Catalog intake tool hashes and inventories source files, records duplicate/classification/lineage candidates, never follows symlinks, refuses output inside the immutable source corpus, and does not auto-discard unique content.
- VSIX release packaging now uses a pinned official `@vscode/vsce` 4.0.0 toolchain, staged Marketplace metadata, publisher validation, and ignored generated release artifacts; Marketplace publication/provenance automation remains open.

## Roadmap and scope state

- #7 remains the durable roadmap umbrella; future substantive approved ideas should be captured in GitHub before implementation or deferral.
- #8 thin VS Code + optional `cc` client/no standalone app: **implementation foundation landed; clean-machine/customer validation remains**.
- #9 first-run/warm-start/lazy activation: **implementation foundation landed; target-workstation behavior remains to validate**.
- #10 surface-aware harness adapters/provider-native capabilities: **implemented in the runtime/configuration baseline**.
- #11 Kiro ACP-first + AWS/spec specialization: **guarded ACP implementation landed; live subscription-policy/read-modify authority remains fail-closed pending workstation validation**.
- #12 explicit provider role/capability routing matrix: **implemented with representative routing tests**.
- #13 full legacy Agent Catalog/APM migration: **immutable intake/lineage tooling landed; the real corpus still requires inventory, semantic review, canonicalization, and 100% lineage closure**.
- #14 Marketplace/VSIX/CLI/provenance/customer trust: **VSIX packaging foundation landed; Marketplace publication, provenance/SBOM/attestation and release automation remain**.
- #15 deterministic engineering-tool model: **policy/model locked; expand representative Terraform/Ansible/PowerShell/cloud profiles as dogfood requires them**.
- #16 APM Agent Plugin ↔ Kiro Powers interoperability: **research/validation remains open**.
- #17 Perplexity manual Pro vs paid automation boundary: **policy locked; automation remains optional/later**.
- #18 Antigravity current `agy` safety revalidation: **still required before unattended execution**.
- #3 repository governance enforcement remains an administrative prerequisite for a trustworthy public release.
- #4 is now the primary v0.1 e## Repository cleanup state

- Foundation/context-optimizer work and the approved architecture/product delta are merged to `main`.
- PRs #19, #20, #24, #25, #26, #27, and #30 represent the consolidation sequence that moved the roadmap architecture, surface-aware runtime, TypeScript-7 compatibility fix, Kiro ACP path, thin VS Code packaging/startup, Agent Catalog intake, and VSIX packaging foundation into the canonical branch.
- Earlier stacked/rebuild branches and closed superseded PRs are historical scaffolding only; no future work should branch from them.
- Temporary one-shot lockfile materialization workflows used during branch repair were removed before merge and are not part of the product/release workflow.
- Repository-level branch protection/ruleset enforcement and automatic merged-branch deletion remain tracked in issue #3 because those repository-settings mutations are outside the current connector's administration surface.

## Not yet release-verified

- Clean-machine installation of the packaged extension/VSIX and activation without a Code Conductor source checkout.
- First-run bootstrap and warm-start latency/resource behavior on the target workstation, including proof that providers/ACP/MCP/APM are not launched unnecessarily.
- Official subscription authentication on the actual execution workstation for Claude, Codex/ChatGPT, Kiro Pro, GitHub Copilot, and Google Antigravity.
- Surface-specific read/modify smoke validation against installed current client versions.
- Kiro ACP subscription-policy boundary and read/modify authority on the target workstation; implementation is present but unattended trust remains fail-closed until this passes.
- Authenticated official MCP behavior for real project profiles before write authority is granted.
- The context optimizer's optional MCP adapter against the official MCP TypeScript SDK/current protocol.
- A complete real R1/R2 task spanning isolated builder work, independent reviewer/challenger roles, deterministic validation, preserved worktree changes, GitHub PR checks/review, structured evidence, and final readiness.
- Google Antigravity unattended execution remains intentionally disabled pending permission/sandbox revalidation.
- Perplexity Pro remains human-in-the-loop unless separately billed official MCP/API automation is explicitly enabled.
- The actual legacy agent/skill corpus inventory, semantic deduplication/canonicalization, modular APM migration, and 100% lineage closure.
- Marketplace publication, release provenance/SBOM/attestation, and customer-facing release-channel validation.

## Immediate next milestone

1. Start from current `main` and execute issue #4 / `docs/WORKSTATION-VALIDATION.md` on the real VS Code workstation.
2. Validate clean packaged extension installation/activation, first-run discovery, and warm lazy startup without a source-tree build dependency.
3. Validate official subscription authentication and surface-specific read/modify trust for Codex, Claude Code, and Kiro ACP; keep Kiro fail-closed until the installed version and current policy boundary pass.
4. Validate only the MCP/reference and deterministic-tool profiles needed for the dogfood repository.
5. Run a real R1 task through Code Conductor in an isolated modifying worktree and capture structured evidence.
6. Raise the same scenario to R2 with a different-provider challenger, deterministic validation, and GitHub Gatekeeper review/re-review.
7. In parallel, run #13 immutable intake against the actual legacy agent/skill corpus and begin reviewed APM canonicalization batches with 100% source-lineage accounting.
8. Continue #14 from the merged VSIX packaging foundation to Marketplace publication, reproducible release automation, SBOM/provenance/attestation, and clean-machine release validation.
9. Validate/revalidate #16/#18 when they can materially change the active release path.
10. Prepare the v0.1 release candidate only when the authoritative definition of done is satisfied.

## Release definition

The authoritative v0.1 definition of done remains in [`IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md`](IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md). This file records progress and approved sequencing; it does not weaken those acceptance criteria.
